Isolate assignment in the info.md file to its own document so that it
can be re-inserted programmatically back in to info.md. Do the same for
the Checks field.  Write the checks alluded to in info.md as a bash
script.  A top level script assemble_test.sh should pull the
assignment and the test files and assemble them into a single info.md
file.
